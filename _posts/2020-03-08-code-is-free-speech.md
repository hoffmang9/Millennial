In 1997 when I was working for the first PGP, Inc., [Bob Kohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kohn), [Roz Thomsen](https://t-b.com/about/our-team/roszel-c-thomsen-ii/), and I had a "crazy like a fox" idea to put the complete source code to [PGP 3.0/5.0 into book form](https://archive.org/details/prettygoodprivacy) in the [OCR-B font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCR-B) and export it. I was the most senior guy involved in the project with the least to lose as my amazing wife had not yet fallen for my charms, exporting it became my problem. After sending the book to the Library of Congress and getting it into a couple of Bay Area book stores, I handed a fully ready to go Fedex box of the book to [Lucky Green](https://twitter.com/luckygreen) at a Cypherpunks meeting. I was the second person to ever be investigated for illegally exporting strong cryptography. The first exporter was actually [Hal Finney](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/31/business/hal-finney-cryptographer-and-bitcoin-pioneer-dies-at-58.html) but Phil Zimmerman bravely chose to [take the heat](https://www.wired.com/1995/03/the-continuing-investigation-of-phil-zimmermann/) instead.

# Thus ended export controls on cryptography

Bob took a signed copy of the source code book to the office of the State Department. They informed him that their investigation of me was complete and that strong cryptography was being removed from the Munitions List at [ITAR](https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/ddtc_public?id=ddtc_public_portal_itar_landing) and transferred to the [Department of Commerce Control List](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/regulations/commerce-control-list-ccl) to now be subject to "Commodity Classification" which was inexpensive and easy to license and generally exempted open source. That would happen only a couple of days after Bob's meeting.

# History repeats itself

The US Government has always been very aware of the tension between the US Munitions List and any impact it would have on publishing software and books.
