In 1997 when I was working for the first PGP, Inc., [Bob Kohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kohn), [Roz Thomsen](https://t-b.com/about/our-team/roszel-c-thomsen-ii/), and I had a "crazy like a fox" idea to put the complete source code to PGP 3.0/5.0 into book form in the [OCR-B font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCR-B) and export it. Being the most senior guy with the least to lose, after sending it to the Library of Congress and getting it into a couple of Bay Area book stores, I handed a fully ready to go Fedex box of the book to [Lucky Green](https://twitter.com/luckygreen) at a Cypherpunks meeting. I was the second person to ever be investigated for illegally exporting strong cryptography. The first exporterer was actually [Hal Finney](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/31/business/hal-finney-cryptographer-and-bitcoin-pioneer-dies-at-58.html) but Phil Zimmerman chose to [take the heat](https://www.wired.com/1995/03/the-continuing-investigation-of-phil-zimmermann/) instead.

# Thus ended export controls on cryptography

Bob took a signed copy of the source code book to the office of the State Department.
